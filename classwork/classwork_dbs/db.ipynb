    "## **Overview**\n",
    "The database architecture consists of multiple layers that work together to process, execute, and store queries efficiently. Below is a detailed explanation of each layer and its subcomponents, based on the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Transport Layer**\n",
    "This layer manages communication between clients and the database system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cluster Communication**\n",
    "- Handles communication between nodes in a distributed database system.\n",
    "- Ensures data replication and synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Client Communication**\n",
    "- Facilitates communication between the database client (e.g., a user or application) and the server.\n",
    "- Manages query requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Query Processor**\n",
    "The query processor interprets and optimizes the SQL queries before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Query Parser**\n",
    "- Converts SQL queries into a machine-readable structure (e.g., Abstract Syntax Tree).\n",
    "- Ensures syntax and semantic correctness.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - Checks if the `employees` table exists and validates syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Query Optimizer**\n",
    "- Determines the most efficient way to execute a query.\n",
    "- Considers factors like available indexes, query filters, and data distribution.\n",
    "- **Example**: For `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';`, the optimizer decides whether to:\n",
    "    - Perform a full table scan.\n",
    "    - Use an index on the `department` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Execution Engine**\n",
    "Executes the optimized query plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remote Execution**\n",
    "- Executes parts of the query on remote nodes in distributed database systems.\n",
    "- Useful for fetching data from sharded or replicated nodes.\n",
    "- **Example**: Fetching data from multiple database servers in a distributed environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Local Execution**\n",
    "- Executes the query directly on the local database server.\n",
    "- Handles queries where all required data is stored on the same server.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Storage Engine**\n",
    "Responsible for how data is stored, retrieved, and managed in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Transaction Manager**\n",
    "- Ensures that database transactions follow the ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n",
    "- **Example**: A money transfer transaction where both debit and credit operations must either succeed together or fail entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lock Manager**\n",
    "- Manages locks to prevent conflicts in a multi-user environment.\n",
    "- **Example**: Ensures two users cannot update the same row in a table simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Access Methods**\n",
    "- Defines how data is accessed (e.g., full table scans, index lookups).\n",
    "- **Example**: Using an index to quickly locate rows where `age > 30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Buffer Manager**\n",
    "- Caches frequently accessed data to improve performance.\n",
    "- **Example**: If a table is repeatedly queried, its data is kept in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recovery Manager**\n",
    "- Restores the database to a consistent state after a crash or failure.\n",
    "- **Example**: After a server crash during a transaction, the recovery manager rolls back incomplete changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Summary**\n",
    "This architecture demonstrates how different components work together to handle query processing, execution, and storage in a database system. Each layer ensures the system is reliable, efficient, and capable of managing large-scale data operations.\n"
