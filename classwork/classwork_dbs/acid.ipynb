    "ACID is a set of properties that ensure reliable processing of database transactions. Each transaction must adhere to these properties to guarantee data integrity, especially in systems that handle concurrent operations or unexpected failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **ACID Stands For:**\n",
    "- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Transactions maintain database integrity.\n",
    "- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions are handled safely.\n",
    "- **Durability**: Data remains safe after a transaction is committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Atomicity**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation**\n",
    "- Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, meaning either all operations are completed or none are.\n",
    "- If any operation in a transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Transferring $100 from Alice’s account to Bob’s account.\n",
    "  1. Debit $100 from Alice’s account.\n",
    "  2. Credit $100 to Bob’s account.\n",
    "- **Atomicity Guarantee**:\n",
    "    - If the debit succeeds but the credit fails (e.g., due to a system crash), the transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "    - Both steps either succeed together or fail together.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE user_id = 'Alice';\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE user_id = 'Bob';\n",
    "\n",
    "-- If an error occurs, rollback the entire transaction\n",
    "ROLLBACK;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- If both operations succeed, commit the transaction\n",

    "## **Consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation**\n",
    "- Ensures that a database moves from one valid state to another after a transaction.\n",
    "- A valid state means all constraints, rules, and relationships are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Adding a new order to the database.\n",
    "    - The `orders` table has a foreign key referencing the `users` table.\n",
    "    - **Consistency Guarantee**: A new order can only be added if the `user_id` exists in the `users` table. If not, the transaction is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "\n",
    "INSERT INTO orders (order_id, user_id, total_price) VALUES (101, 999, 500.00);\n",

    "- Ensures that transactions are executed independently of one another.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "- **Scenario**: Two users, Alice and Bob, try to book the last seat in a flight simultaneously.\n",
    "    - **Isolation Guarantee**: Only one transaction will succeed in booking the seat. The other transaction will see the updated state and fail gracefully.\n",
