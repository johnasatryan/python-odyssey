    "# **Choosing the Right Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Variables for Choosing a Database**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Schema and Record Sizes**\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The structure of the data (schema) and the size of individual records affect the storage and performance requirements.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - Schema: A `users` table with columns: `id` (int), `name` (varchar), `email` (varchar), `profile_picture` (binary data).\n",
    "  - Record Size: If the average size of a `profile_picture` is 1 MB, storing 1 million users would require ~1 TB of storage.\n",
    "- **Impact**: \n",
    "  - Databases like PostgreSQL are suitable for structured, schema-based data.\n",
    "  - MongoDB is better for flexible or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Number of Clients**\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The number of simultaneous users or connections a database must handle.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - A blog website with 100 users per day might use SQLite.\n",
    "  - A social media platform with millions of daily users needs a scalable database like PostgreSQL or Cassandra.\n",
    "- **Impact**: \n",
    "  - PostgreSQL and MySQL handle moderate concurrency.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases like Cassandra are designed for high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Types of Queries and Access Patterns**\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The types of queries (e.g., reads, writes, aggregations) and how data is accessed (e.g., sequential, random).\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - **Transactional Workload**: A banking app frequently updates balances:  \n",
    "    `UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1`.\n",
    "  - **Analytical Workload**: An e-commerce site analyzes sales trends:  \n",
    "    `SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) FROM sales GROUP BY product_id`.\n",
    "- **Impact**:\n",
    "  - Transaction-heavy apps favor relational databases like PostgreSQL.\n",
    "  - Analytical apps benefit from data warehouses like Amazon Redshift.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Rates of Read and Write Queries**\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The ratio of reads to writes affects the database's architecture.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - **High Read, Low Write**: A news website sees more reads (`SELECT`) than writes (`INSERT`).\n",
    "  - **High Write, Moderate Read**: An IoT system writes sensor data constantly but only queries recent readings occasionally.\n",
    "- **Impact**: \n",
    "  - High-read systems may use caching (e.g., Redis).\n",
    "  - High-write systems may use append-only databases like InfluxDB for time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Expected Changes in Variables**\n",
    "- **Explanation**: Anticipated growth in data volume, query complexity, or user base.\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - A startup with 10,000 users today expects to scale to 1 million users in a year.\n",
    "  - Current schema includes basic user details, but future plans include user activity logs and analytics.\n",
    "- **Impact**:\n",
    "  - A relational database may work initially but might need horizontal scaling or sharding as data grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Questions to Answer**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Does the database support the required queries?**\n",
    "- **Example**: MongoDB does not support complex joins, so it may not be suitable for a system requiring many relational queries like `INNER JOIN`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Is this database able to handle the amount of data weâ€™re planning to store?**\n",
    "- **Example**: SQLite may work for a single-user application but struggles with terabytes of data. PostgreSQL or Cassandra is better for large-scale storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. How many read and write operations can a single node handle?**\n",
    "- **Example**: A single PostgreSQL node can handle around 10,000 queries per second. If your system needs 100,000 queries per second, consider horizontal scaling or caching layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. How many nodes should the system have?**\n",
    "- **Example**: A system with 1 TB of data and frequent queries may require a distributed database with 5 nodes, each handling 200 GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. How do we expand the cluster given the expected growth rate?**\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - Current: 10 nodes handle 1 million users.\n",
    "  - Expected: 50 nodes required for 5 million users.\n",
    "  - Solution: Use databases like Cassandra, which allow adding nodes to the cluster dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. What is the maintenance process?**\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "  - PostgreSQL requires regular backups and `VACUUM` operations to prevent table bloat.\n",
    "  - MongoDB automates many maintenance tasks but may require manual shard rebalancing in distributed setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Scenario Example: E-commerce Platform**\n",
    "- **Variables**:\n",
    "  - Schema: Tables for products, users, and orders.\n",
    "  - Number of Clients: 10,000 daily users, 500 simultaneous connections.\n",
    "  - Query Types: `SELECT` for product details, `INSERT` for new orders.\n",
    "  - Read/Write Ratio: 80% reads, 20% writes.\n",
    "  - Growth: Expecting 10x growth in users and orders within a year.\n",
    "- **Database Choice**:\n",
    "  - Start with PostgreSQL for relational capabilities.\n",
    "  - Add a Redis cache for high read performance.\n",
    "  - Plan for scaling with partitioning or sharding.\n",
